# A Remix app of a blog of a collection of links of JavaScript, Remix

Just when you think you have had enough of JavaScript, React, Next Js ... and all that Jazz (js) ðŸ¥³

This is my collection of weekly links of things that might seem important in the universe of web development. JavaScript, React, Next Js, Remix, css. Basic or not so basic or something random (to you).

A lot of the links I simply collected from work. Why not?

## Development

To run your Remix app locally, make sure your project's local dependencies are installed:

```sh
npm install
```

Afterwards, start the Remix development server like so:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open up [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) and you should be ready to go!

If you're used to using the `vercel dev` command provided by [Vercel CLI](https://vercel.com/cli) instead, you can also use that, but it's not needed.
